<!-- simple html input, no angular here -->

<input type="text" name="title" />

<!--
	ngModel directive binds input DOM element to data model, it is not related to Form (class) or FormControl
 -->

<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="todo.title" />
<input type="text" [ngModel]="todo.title" (ngModelChange)="todo.title=$event" />

<!--
	ngControl creates Control (class) for input in [ng]Form and adds it to ngForm.form (:ControlGroup) instance as a child.
	Control has a value, validation state, validators, etc.
	It binds Control to input, tracks changes, runs validators.
	Input name needs to be supplied in order to identify it in ngForm.form.controls
	It's not related to ngModel.
 -->

<input type="text" ngControl="title" />

<!--
   ngFormControl binds input to some custom Control instance (e.g. created within component constructor).
   Same as ngControl, but it's not connected to form (unless you do that explicitly)
 -->

<input type="text" [ngFormControl]="titleControl" />

<!--
	Input is bound to both Control instance and model.
	ngModel is NOT a separate directive - it's used as an attribute for ngControl which directly updates the model (no need for two directives doing same thing)
 -->

<input type="text" ngControl="title" [(ngModel)]="todo.title" />
